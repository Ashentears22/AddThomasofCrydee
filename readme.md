# About
This mod adds 20 Bretonnia Lord variants, 10 of which are your usual sword & shield lord, 5 are lords with mighty two handed sword, and another 5 are unusually large dukes (maybe their ancestors are from Norsca or something).

This mod employs script to spawn these rare variants:
- 2 handed sword Lords
- Brute Lords (much rarer)

# How to build?
Run first time bat and to compile, run build_campaign.bat. You still need to pack the script manually. 
3d assets and database can be downloaded here https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2867514081     

# Warhammer-header.d.ts
Yeah, there are lots of function needs to be included here, I'm not even working on UI stuff. 

# Notice
- This game modifies your save game, once enabled, you can't remove it.
- Should be multiplayer friendly as it doesn't touch player faction directly.
- The AI can get rare variants, too.
